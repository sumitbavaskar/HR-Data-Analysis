## 📌 Objectives

- Perform basic data cleaning and exploration
- Visualize relationships between key features
- Identify potential insights related to employee behavior and retention

- Format: CSV
- Columns include:
  - `satisfaction_level`
  - `last_evaluation`
  - `number_project`
  - `average_montly_hours`
  - `time_spend_company`
  - `Work_accident`, `left`, `promotion_last_5years`, `sales`, `salary`

## 📊 Key Findings
